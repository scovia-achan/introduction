                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the 
                    presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone 
                    technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies 
                    if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>
                <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
                    and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and 
                    control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share 
                    formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and 
                    repetition in the structural content.</p>

                <p>What is CSS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS stands for Cascading style sheets</li>
                    <li>CSS describes how HTML elementsare to be displayedon screen, paper or in other media</li>
                    <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
                    <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in 
                    different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice 
                    (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has 
                    rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>

                <p>Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the 
                    HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had 
                    to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much 
                    of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.</p>
                <p>Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 
                    headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type.</p>
                <p>This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS 
                    allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, 
                    size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently 
                    for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis 
                    for aural text readers</p>

                <p>CSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding 
                    new features and typically denoted as CSS 1, CSS 2, CSS 3, and CSS 4. Profiles are typically a 
                    subset of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface. Currently 
                    there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television sets. Profiles should not be confused 
                    with media types, which were added in CSS 2.</p>

                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. 
                    It defines the meaning and structure of web content</p>
                <p>CSS can be added to HTML elements in three ways: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inline</strong> -by using the style attribute in HTML elements</li>
                    <li><strong>internal</strong> -by using a style element in the head section</li>
                    <li><strong>External</strong> -by using an external CSS file</li>

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>

                <p>A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block</p>
                <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</p>
                <p>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</p>        
                <p>Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</p>    
                <p>A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces</p>
                <p>View the example below:</p>
                p
                {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;text-align: center;<br>

                    <li><strong>Element selector: </strong> selects elements based on the element namefor example p</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>id selector: </strong>uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element should be unique within 
                        a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element. To select an element with a specific id, 
                        write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Class selectors: </strong>selects elements with a specific class attribute.To select elements with a specific 
                        class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li><strong>Grouping selectors</strong> used to style elements with the same style definitions.For example h1 elements can be styled in the same way</li>
                </ul>
